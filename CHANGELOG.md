# Changelog

## 0.3.1 (2026-03-25)

### Fixes
- **Pitch deck question removed from installer** - The "start with pitch or Product Brief?" prompt was a config-time decision that should be runtime. Removed from installer; Saga now asks at activation when relevant. Supports monorepo workflows where multiple products have different starting points.
- **Skills file format** - Skills were installed to `.claude/skills/wds/saga.md` but Claude Code expects `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`. Fixed paths to `.claude/skills/saga/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/freya/SKILL.md`.
- **Learning material location** - `_wds-learn/` moved from project root into `_bmad/wds/learn/` to reduce root-level noise, especially in monorepos.

### Improvements
- **Module help CSV modernized** - New 13-column format with dependency graph (after/before), optional descriptions, and concise single-sentence entries.
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Added quality checks, NPM publish on tag, manual release workflow, and Discord notifications.

## 0.3.0 (2026-03-01)

### Breaking Changes
- **Two agents** - Removed Mimir orchestrator and Idunn PM. Only Saga (analyst) and Freya (designer + development) remain.
- **BMAD standard path** - Default installation path changed from `_wds/` to `_bmad/wds/`. Existing `_wds/` projects get a migration prompt.
- **Design Log replaces Agent Dialogs** - Single `00-design-log.md` with Backlog, Current, Design Loop Status, and Log sections replaces the multi-file Agent Dialog system.
- **VTC removed** - Value Trigger Chain concept removed entirely. Scenarios and content reference the Trigger Map directly.

### Features
- **9-step Design Loop** - Discuss, Spec, Wireframe, Approve, Iterate, Update Spec, Implement, Browser Review, Extract Tokens. Excalidraw default wireframing tool, PNG export as approval gate.
- **Spacing as first-class objects** - Named tokens (space-3xs to space-3xl), spacing objects with IDs in page specs, patterns section in design system.
- **8-question Scenario Dialog** - Replaces the old 7-component scenario template with a more conversational approach.
- **Adaptive dashboard in Phase 4** - Reads design log and suggests where to continue. Two-option transitions replace dead-end menus.
- **Token extraction** - Agents extract design system tokens from completed pages automatically.
- **Installer improvements** - Detects existing installations, update/migrate first, skips config on update. IDE multiselect, platform-agnostic. Optional learning material.

### Fixes
- Path references across 14+ files (D-UX-Design → C-UX-Scenarios)
- Duplicate trigger-map references
- Workflow routing and step chain cohesion (6-item audit)
- Learn section synced to v0.3.0 (24 files updated)

## 0.2.3 (2026-02-23)

### Features
- **Root folder selection** - Installer now asks where to create work products folder (design-process/, docs/, or deliverables/)

### Fixes
- **Duplicate folders** - Fixed issue where both design-process/ and docs/ folders were created during installation

## 0.2.2 (2026-02-23)

### Fixes
- **Installer crash** - Fixed "config is not defined" error during installation. The `createDocsFolders` method now correctly receives the config parameter needed for template replacements.

## 0.2.1 (2026-02-22)

### Known Issues
- **Installer crash** - Installation fails with "config is not defined" error. Fixed in 0.2.2.

## 0.2.0 (2026-02-20)

### Breaking Changes
- **Restructured workflows** - All workflow phases reorganized for BMad compliance (phases 0-8). Existing installations should do a fresh install.
- **Templates moved** - Top-level `templates/` directory removed. Templates now live inside their respective workflow folders.
- **Doc folders renamed** - `C-Platform-Requirements` → `C-UX-Scenarios`, added `E-PRD`, `F-Testing`, `G-Product-Development`, removed `F-Agent-Dialogs`.

### Features
- **Skills directory** - Added agent activation files (`skills/`) for `/freya`, `/idunn`, `/saga` commands.
- **Workflow registry** - Added `module-help.csv` with full workflow index and descriptions.
- **BMad path rewriting** - Compiler now handles `_bmad/wds/` paths from expansion module agents.

### Fixes
- **Agent menu paths** - Updated all agent workflow references to match restructured directories.
- **Stale documentation references** - Fixed old phase paths in agent guides and dialog templates.

## 0.1.1 (2026-01-29)

### Changes
- **Learning material moved** - Installer now places optional learning & reference material in `_wds-learn/` at the project root (safe to delete without touching `_wds/`).
- **Docs & messaging** - Updated README and post-install guidance to reference `_wds-learn/`.

## 0.1.0 (2026-01-29)

Initial public release on npm.

### Features
- **npm installer** - `npx whiteport-design-studio install` sets up WDS in any project
- **4 AI agents** - Mimir (Orchestrator), Saga (Analyst), Idunn (PM), Freya (Designer)
- **17 IDE configurations** - Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, GitHub Copilot, and more
- **Agent compiler** - Compiles `.agent.yaml` definitions into ready-to-use `.md` files
- **Project scaffolding** - Creates `docs/` folder structure (A-F) with `.gitkeep` files
- **Learning material** - Optional inclusion of training courses, method guides, and tool references
- **Update support** - Re-run the installer to update WDS files while preserving your `config.yaml`
