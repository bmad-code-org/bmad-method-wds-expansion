# Lesson 12: Using Strategic Context Across Your Project

**Time: 20 min | Focus: Strategy | Prerequisites: Tutorial 06B**

## Beyond Your First Trigger Map

Tutorial 06B taught you how to create a Slim Trigger Map — a focused, lightweight version of the full Trigger Map. This lesson covers the bigger picture: when to use the Slim version vs. the full map, how scenarios reference the Trigger Map, and how to manage strategic context across a complex product.

## When to Use Slim Trigger Map vs. Full Trigger Map

### Use Slim Trigger Map (Lightweight) When:

**Time:**
- < 2 weeks total timeline
- Need to start NOW
- Can't dedicate 1-2 days to mapping

**Scope:**
- 1-3 key flows
- Single primary user
- Focused project/prototype
- Standalone scenario

**Resources:**
- Small team
- Limited research budget
- Founder/solo designer

**Context:**
- Quick validation
- MVP/POC
- Early-stage exploration

**Result:** Sufficient strategic grounding for focused work

---

### Use Full Trigger Map (Comprehensive) When:

**Time:**
- > 1 month timeline
- Can invest 1-2 days upfront
- Long-term product

**Scope:**
- Multiple user types
- Complex product
- Many scenarios
- Full platform

**Resources:**
- Full team
- Research capacity
- Stakeholder availability

**Context:**
- Strategic foundation needed
- Prioritization crucial
- Long shelf life desired

**Result:** Deep strategic foundation for the entire project

## How Scenarios Reference the Trigger Map

### Purpose

Each scenario selects the relevant context from your Trigger Map — the business goal, persona, and driving forces that apply to that specific user journey.

### Typical Flow
```
Scenario Identified
  ↓
Reference Trigger Map
  ├─ Select relevant business goal
  ├─ Select relevant persona
  └─ Select relevant driving forces
  ↓
Strategic context assigned to Scenario
  ↓
All pages in scenario inherit this context
  ↓
Design decisions reference the Trigger Map
```

### Multiple Scenarios, Same Trigger Map

Each scenario picks the nodes it needs from the Trigger Map. Different scenarios may reference different goals and personas:

**Example: User Onboarding Product**

```
Scenario 1: First Visit (Landing Page)
Strategic Context:
- Goal: 500 signups
- Persona: Curious visitor
- Forces: Want to understand, fear commitment
- Awareness: Problem Aware → Product Aware

Scenario 2: Account Setup
Strategic Context:
- Goal: 80% activation
- Persona: New signup
- Forces: Want quick value, fear complexity
- Awareness: Product Aware → Most Aware

Scenario 3: Dashboard (First Use)
Strategic Context:
- Goal: 80% activation
- Persona: First-time user
- Forces: Want to feel capable, fear looking stupid
- Awareness: Most Aware (maintain and deepen)
```

**Notice:** Same Trigger Map, different context selected per scenario.

## Tips for Selecting Strategic Context

**Don't Overthink:**
- This is a heuristic, not science
- Better to pick roughly right context than none
- Can refine as you learn

**Be Specific:**
- Generic = not useful
- "Save time" → "Save time doing WHAT?"
- "Better experience" → "Feel capable doing WHAT?"

**Test It:**
- After selecting context, try making a design decision
- Does it guide you?
- If not, select different forces or refine the Trigger Map

## Common Questions

### Q: How much context does each scenario need?

**Minimum:** One business goal, one persona, their top 2-3 driving forces.
**Maximum:** Whatever helps you make design decisions. Don't overload.

### Q: Can scenarios share the same context?

Yes, if they serve the same goal, same persona, same forces. But often scenarios have slightly different contexts, so selecting specifically per scenario maintains clarity.

### Q: What if I have a Slim Trigger Map but need more depth?

Upgrade to the full Trigger Map workshop. Your Slim Trigger Map becomes input — you're not starting from scratch.

### Q: What if I don't have a Trigger Map yet?

Phase 2 (Trigger Mapping) creates the Trigger Map. If you're in a later phase without one, go back and create it — even a Slim version is better than guessing.

### Q: How do I know if the context is good enough?

Ask: "Can I make design decisions from this?"
- Yes → It's good enough
- No → Which part is too vague? Select different forces or refine the map

## Using the Trigger Map in Pitches

When presenting to stakeholders, reference your Trigger Map directly:

**Slide 1: The Opportunity**
- Business Goal (from Trigger Map)

**Slide 2: The User**
- Persona description (from Trigger Map)
- Their driving forces (from Trigger Map)

**Slide 3: Our Solution**
- How it addresses positive forces
- How it reduces negative forces

**Slide 4: The Journey**
- Customer Awareness progression
- What changes for the user

**Important:** The Trigger Map is created in Phase 2, not during the Product Brief (Phase 1). Phase 1 captures casual business context. The deep strategic analysis happens in Phase 2.

## Maintenance

### When the Trigger Map Changes
1. Review all scenarios that reference it
2. Check if selected context still aligns
3. Update scenario context if needed
4. Document changes

### When Scenarios Reveal New Insights
1. If scenario work reveals new driving forces, update the Trigger Map
2. If a persona doesn't quite fit, refine the persona in the Trigger Map
3. The Trigger Map is a living document — it grows with your understanding

## Success Metrics

**Good strategic context when:**
- Designer can make decisions without asking "why?"
- Content creator knows which driving forces to address
- Stakeholders understand strategic reasoning
- Team aligned on WHO and WHY
- Can evaluate design alternatives objectively

**Context needs work when:**
- Team argues about design opinions (not strategy)
- Content feels generic
- Can't explain why design choice serves strategy
- Driving forces too vague to inform design
