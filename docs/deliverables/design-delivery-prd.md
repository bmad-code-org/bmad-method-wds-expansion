# Deliverable: Design Delivery PRD

**Package everything developers need - turn specs into buildable epics and stories**

---

## About WDS & the Design Delivery PRD

**WDS (Whiteport Design Studio)** is an AI agent framework module within the BMAD Method that transforms how designers work. Instead of creating documentation that gets lost in translation, your design work becomes **powerful prompts** that guide AI agents and development teams with precision and intent.

**The Design Delivery PRD** is the final bridge between design and development. Freya takes your page specifications and design system and organizes them into developer-ready epics, stories, and implementation sequences. This is where your design work transforms into actionable development tasks.

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Design Delivery PRD organizes your page specifications and design system into developer-ready documentation:
- Epic breakdown (major features)
- User stories (specific tasks)
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical dependencies
- Implementation sequence
- Links back to page specifications

**Created by:** Freya the Designer
**When:** Phase 7 - After page specs and design system are complete  
**Format:** PRD document with epics, stories, and implementation guide

## Why This Matters

**Without a Design Delivery PRD:**
- ❌ Developers start coding without full context
- ❌ Implementation order is inefficient
- ❌ Design intent gets lost in translation
- ❌ "What did you mean?" meetings daily
- ❌ Specifications sit unused

**With a Design Delivery PRD:**
- ✅ Clear implementation roadmap
- ✅ Developers understand the full picture
- ✅ Efficient build sequence
- ✅ Specifications become actionable tasks
- ✅ Reduced rework and confusion

---

## What's Included

### 1. Implementation Strategy
- Development phases
- Priority order
- Technical dependencies
- Resource requirements
- Timeline estimates

### 2. Epics
For each major feature:
- Epic name and description
- Business value
- User stories included
- Technical dependencies
- Acceptance criteria at epic level

### 3. User Stories
For each story:
- Story format: "As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria (specific, testable)
- Linked page specifications
- Design system components used
- Technical notes
- Estimation (story points or time)

### 4. Component Mapping
- Which design system components are needed
- Where components are used
- Reusability opportunities
- Implementation order (dependencies)

### 5. Handoff Documentation
- How to read page specifications
- Object ID system explanation
- Content strategy references
- Testing requirements
- Quality criteria

## The Dialog with Your Design Partner: Freya the Designer

**The Process (2-3 hours):**

Freya helps you organize for development:

```
Freya: "Let's package this for development. I've analyzed your 8 page
        specifications. I see 3 major epics."

You: "What are they?"

Freya: "Epic 1: User Authentication & Profile.
        Epic 2: Project Dashboard.
        Epic 3: Task Management. Sound right?"

You: "Perfect! Which should we build first?"

Freya: "Authentication is foundational - everything depends on it.
        Dashboard next, then Task Management. I'll create stories..."

You: "How many stories total?"

Freya: "15 stories across the 3 epics. Each links directly to
        your page specifications with Object IDs."
```

As you work together, Freya creates:
- ✅ Epic breakdown
- ✅ User stories with acceptance criteria
- ✅ Implementation sequence
- ✅ Component mapping
- ✅ Handoff documentation

Then you review together:

```
Freya: "Here's your Design Delivery PRD. Ready for development?"

You: "Move the profile settings story to phase 2 - not critical for MVP."

Freya: "Moved to Epic 4: Post-MVP Enhancements. ✅ PRD is ready."
```

**Result:** Design Delivery PRD ready for development team handoff
