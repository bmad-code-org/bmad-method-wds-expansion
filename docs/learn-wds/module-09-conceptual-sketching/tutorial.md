# Tutorial: Conceptual Sketching

**Just show me how to do it.**

---

## Prerequisites

- Scenario outline
- Any visualization method (paper, Figma, whiteboard, AI)
- 30 minutes

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Entry Point

| If you have... | Do this... |
|----------------|------------|
| Ideas in your head | Workshop with Freya |
| Rough sketches | Send them to Freya |
| Inspiration from other sites | Share screenshots |
| Nothing yet | Ask Freya to dream it up |

---

## Step 2: Workshop (If Starting Fresh)

```
You are Freya, a WDS design agent.

Here's my scenario:
[paste scenario-overview.md]

Let's workshop the first logical view: [view name].

What should the user see when they land here?
```

Talk through it. Freya will ask clarifying questions.

---

## Step 3: Visualize

Pick any method:

- **Paper sketch** — Draw it, photo it
- **Figma wireframe** — Quick boxes and text
- **Whiteboard** — Rough layout
- **AI generation** — "Generate 3 layout options"
- **ASCII art** — Text-based boxes
- **Vibe code** — Quick prototype, screenshot states

---

## Step 4: Capture Keyframe 0

This is the **default state** — what users see when the page loads.

No interactions yet. No animations. Just the starting point.

Ask Freya:

```
Here's my sketch for [view name]:
[describe or paste image]

What's missing? What questions do you have?
```

---

## Step 5: Annotate with WHY

Every element needs a reason:

```
[Hero Section]
WHY: First thing Felix sees — addresses his fear of complicated onboarding

[CTA Button]
WHY: Primary action — connects to S01 signup flow
```

---

## Step 6: Explore Variants

Don't settle on the first idea.

```
Show me 2 alternative layouts for this view.
What are the tradeoffs?
```

Pick the one that best serves your Trigger Map.

---

## Step 7: Save Your Sketches

Add to your scenario folder:

```
docs/C-Scenarios/
└── S01-User-Registration/
    ├── scenario-overview.md
    └── sketches/
        ├── P01-signup-sketch.png
        └── P01-signup-notes.md
```

## The Great Divide

Remember: conceptualization → specification → production.

Cool mockups are great. But you still need a specification.

---

## Done!

You have visualized keyframe 0 for your views.
