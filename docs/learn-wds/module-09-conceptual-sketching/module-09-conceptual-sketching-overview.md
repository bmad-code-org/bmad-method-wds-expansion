# Module 09: Conceptual Sketching

**Time: 45 min | Agent: Freya | Phase: Design**

## Visualize the Default State

You need to see it. How you get there is up to you.

This is **keyframe 0** — the default state of each logical view, what the user sees when the page first loads.

Everything that happens *after* (interactions, animations, state changes) comes in Module 10: Storyboarding.

---

## Why Visualize First?

You need to see it before you can specify it. Visualization is faster than words for spatial problems.

Sketching is one way to visualize. Not the only way.

- Where does this element go?
- How big should it be?
- What's the visual hierarchy?
- Does this layout make sense?

You can't answer these questions in a specification. You have to see it.

---

## The Conceptual Mindset

### Low Fidelity on Purpose

Rough visuals prevent attachment. If it looks finished, you'll defend it.

Keep it ugly. Keep it fast. Keep it flexible.

### Quantity Over Quality

First idea is rarely best. Explore 3-5 approaches before picking one.

### Think Out Loud

Visualize while talking through the scenario. What does the user see first? What draws their attention? Where do they click?

---

## Entry Points

You don't have to start from scratch.

| Entry Point | How It Works |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Workshop** | Talk through the screen together — conversation shapes the concept |
| **Visualize** | Send any visual — AI analyzes and refines |
| **Example** | "I like how this site does it" → AI extracts patterns |
| **Dream it up** | "Show me 3 ways to lay out a signup form" → AI generates options |

**Same output. Different starting points.**

---

## Ways to Visualize

You can send anything visual. All methods work. Use them interchangeably within a scenario or storyboard.

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pixel-perfect Figma** | You already have detailed designs |
| **Wireframes** | Structure without visual noise |
| **Hand sketch (paper)** | Fastest way to think out loud |
| **Hand sketch (digital)** | iPad, tablet, stylus |
| **Whiteboard concepts** | Rough, collaborative, big picture |
| **Screen dumps** | "This feature from another product" |
| **Generated images** | AI creates options for you |
| **ASCII art** | Quick text-based layouts from AI |
| **Vibe coded example** | Quick prototype → agent screenshots states |

Mix and match. One view might be a polished wireframe, another a napkin sketch. Doesn't matter — as long as it communicates the concept.

---

## The Great Divide

You can make something amazing with AI. Beautiful mockups. Working prototypes. Impressive demos.

But then what?

**There's a great divide between conceptualizing and producing.**

In the middle stands the specification — with its static visualization.

```
┌───────────────┐         ┌───────────────┐         ┌───────────────┐
│ CONCEPTUALIZE │ ──────► │ SPECIFICATION │ ──────► │   PRODUCTION  │
│               │         │               │         │     CODE      │
│ Cool mockups  │         │ Static visual │         │ Real software │
│ AI demos      │         │ + behavior    │         │               │
│ Prototypes    │         │ + content     │         │               │
└───────────────┘         └───────────────┘         └───────────────┘
    Creative                  The Bridge                Deliverable
```

No matter how cool your concept — you still create a specification. That's what gets built.

## The Freya Method

Freya helps you explore visually:

> "Based on Felix's fear of complicated signups, what's the simplest layout?"
> "Here are 3 approaches — which resonates with your trigger map?"
> "I notice this sketch has 5 fields. Your spec says 3. Which is right?"

She keeps you connected to strategy while exploring form.

---

## What to Visualize

For each logical view in your scenario:

1. **Overall layout** — Where do major elements go?
2. **Visual hierarchy** — What's most important?
3. **User flow** — Where does the eye travel?
4. **Key interactions** — What's clickable?

---

## Not Yet

At this stage, don't worry about:

- Colors (too early)
- Final typography (too early)
- Exact spacing (too early)
- Animations (too early)

Those come in Visual Design (Module 13).

---

## Quick Visualization Patterns

Whatever method you use, these patterns communicate clearly.

### Boxes and Labels

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│      HEADER         │
├─────────────────────┤
│                     │
│   [Form Area]       │
│                     │
├─────────────────────┤
│   [ CTA Button ]    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Annotation

Add notes explaining WHY:
- "CTA prominent because Felix wants to try quickly"
- "Minimal fields to reduce friction"

### Variants

Sketch the same screen 3 different ways. Label them A, B, C. Pick the best.

---

## Output

Rough sketches showing the **default state** of each logical view in your scenario.

Not polished. Not pretty. Just clear enough to:
- Understand what the user sees first
- Know where key elements are positioned
- Serve as keyframe 0 for storyboarding

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too polished | Keep it rough |
| Only one idea | Explore 3 variants |
| Skipping annotation | Add the WHY |
| Designing in isolation | Reference your scenario |

---

## Practice

Take one scenario from Module 08:

1. Identify the key logical views
2. Visualize each one (use any entry point)
3. Annotate with WHY
4. Discuss with Freya

---

## Next Module

**[Module 10: Storyboarding →](../module-10-storyboarding/module-10-storyboarding-overview.md)**

Show how elements transform within each view — keyframe by keyframe.
