# WDS Course: From Designer to Linchpin

**Master creative discipline where design becomes the product**

---

## The WDS Philosophy

> The design IS the specification.
> The specification IS the product.
> The code is just the printout.

You're not handing off mockups. You're handing off **decisions**.

**Creative discipline enables creativity, not constrains it.**

---

## Course Structure (18 Modules)

| Phase | Modules | Agent | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Foundation | 01-02 | — | Paradigm shift, setup |
| Strategy | 03-06 | Saga | Vision, users, boundaries |
| Design | 07-15 | Freya | The heart of WDS |
| Implementation | 16-18 | Idunn | Build, test, evolve |

**Total: 18 modules • ~10 hours • Lifetime of indispensability**

---

# Foundation

## Module 01: The Paradigm Shift

**Time: 30 min • No tutorial — just transformation**

### The Problem

Designers create beautiful mockups. Developers interpret them. Intent gets lost. The final product feels... different.

You become a mockup machine. Replaceable. Frustrated.

### The Shift

What if your design WAS the specification?

Not "here's a pretty picture, figure it out" but "here's exactly what this does, why it does it, and how every piece connects to user psychology and business goals."

**The developer's job becomes translation, not interpretation.**

### Creative Discipline

> "Creative discipline enables creativity, not constrains it."

- **Freedom within focus** — Dream wildly, but one step at a time
- **Rigor enables artistry** — Discipline creates space for creativity
- **Practiced intuition** — Do it enough and it becomes instinct
- **Constraints unlock options** — Knowing boundaries lets you explore freely

### The Three Agents

You're not alone. Three AI agents embody WDS:

- **Saga** (Strategy) — Asks WHY before WHAT
- **Freya** (Design) — Thinks WITH you, not FOR you
- **Idunn** (Implementation) — Builds, tests, evolves

They don't replace you. They amplify you.

### The Future

Today: AI-assisted, human in the loop.
Tomorrow: Dream mode — AI creates options, you pick.
Vision: Full autonomous — agents create, you approve milestones.

**The creative discipline stays the same. Only the executor changes.**

## Module 02: Installation & Setup

**Time: 20 min • Tutorial included**

### What You'll Do

1. Install BMad Method with WDS module
2. Configure your project
3. Meet your agents
4. Understand the output structure

### The Output Structure

```
your-project/
└── docs/
    ├── A-Product-Brief/     ← Strategy (Saga)
    ├── B-Trigger-Map/       ← User psychology (Saga)
    ├── C-Scenarios/         ← Designs (Freya)
    └── D-Design-System/     ← Components (optional)
```

### Design System Modes

Configured at setup:

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **1. None** | Quick projects, ad-hoc styling |
| **2. Building** | First project, system grows from design |
| **3. Component Library** | Using shadcn/Radix + your branding |
| **4. Existing** | Second project, same client |

---

# Strategy Phase — Saga

## Module 03: Alignment (Optional)

**Time: 30 min • For consultants and teams needing buy-in**

### When You Need This

- Consultant proposing to client
- Need stakeholder approval
- Multiple decision-makers
- Budget sign-off required

### Skip If

- Building your own product
- Small team, high trust
- Decision-maker is you

### What You'll Create

1. **Pitch** — Why this product, why now
2. **Service Agreement** — What's included
3. **Signoff** — Formal commitment to proceed

---

## Module 04: Project Brief

**Time: 45 min • Required**

### The Foundation of Everything

Every design decision traces back here. This is your North Star.

### What You'll Define

1. **Vision** — What world are we creating?
2. **Positioning** — How are we different?
3. **Success Criteria** — How do we know we won?
4. **Scope** — What's in, what's out?

### The Saga Method

Saga doesn't interrogate. She explores WITH you.

"Tell me about your users..." becomes a conversation that uncovers insights you didn't know you had.

### Output

`A-Product-Brief/project-brief.md`

---

## Module 05: Trigger Mapping

**Time: 60 min • Required • The secret weapon**

### Why This Changes Everything

Most designers guess what users want. You're going to KNOW.

Trigger Mapping connects:
**Business goals → User groups → Psychology → Features**

### The Five Workshops

1. **Business Goals** — What does success look like?
2. **Target Groups** — Who are we designing for?
3. **Personas** — Names, fears, desires (alliterative: Harriet the Hairdresser)
4. **Driving Forces** — What pushes them to act? What holds them back?
5. **Feature Impact** — Which features move which triggers?

### Output

```
B-Trigger-Map/
├── trigger-map.md
├── personas/
└── feature-impact-analysis.md
```

---

## Module 06: Platform Requirements

**Time: 30 min • Strategic boundaries**

### Not Architecture — Boundaries

You're not designing the database. You're understanding what's possible.

### What You'll Discover

1. **Platforms** — Web? Mobile? Both?
2. **Integrations** — What systems must connect?
3. **Constraints** — What's technically impossible?
4. **Risks** — What needs validation before design?

**Know your boundaries before you design within them.**

### Output

`A-Product-Brief/platform-requirements.md`

# Design Phase — Freya

## Module 07: The Design Phase

**Time: 20 min • Overview**

### The Heart of WDS

9 modules. This is where creative discipline becomes real.

### The Flow

```
Outline → Sketch → Storyboard → Specify → Components → Visual → System → Deliver
```

It's not linear. It's iterative. You'll loop back. That's the point.

### Multiple Entry Points

Every step offers choices:

| Entry Point | How It Works |
|-------------|--------------|
| **I have a sketch** | AI analyzes and refines |
| **I have inspiration** | AI extracts patterns |
| **Dream it up** | AI creates options, you pick |
| **Let's discuss** | Conversation shapes concept |

**Same step. Same output. Different starting points.**

### What You'll Create

- Scenario outlines
- Conceptual sketches
- Storyboards
- Detailed specifications
- Functional components
- Visual designs
- Design system (if enabled)
- Delivery package

---

## Module 08: Outline Scenarios

**Time: 30 min**

### Scenarios, Not Pages

You don't design "a login page." You design "new user creates account and experiences first success."

**Scenarios are journeys. Pages are stops along the way.**

### What Makes a Good Scenario

- Clear starting trigger
- Defined success state
- Connected to persona and driving forces
- Testable

### Naming

`S01-User-Registration` not `login-page`

### Output

```
C-Scenarios/
└── S01-User-Registration/
    └── scenario-overview.md
```

---

## Module 09: Conceptual Sketching

**Time: 45 min**

### Fast, Rough, Exploratory

Paper, tablet, Excalidraw — whatever works.

You're not making art. You're thinking visually.

### Entry Points

- Hand sketch → AI refines
- Inspiration image → AI extracts patterns
- "Dream it up" → AI generates options
- Discussion → Conversation shapes concept

### Output

Rough sketches ready for storyboarding.

---

## Module 10: Storyboarding

**Time: 45 min**

### Sequence the Journey

How does the user move through this scenario?

### What You'll Map

1. Entry point — How did they get here?
2. Key screens — What do they see?
3. Transitions — How do they move between?
4. Success state — How do they know they're done?
5. Error paths — What if something goes wrong?

### Output

Visual flow showing screen sequence and transitions.

---

## Module 11: Conceptual Specifications

**Time: 60 min • The core of WDS**

### Every Decision Documented

This is where design becomes specification.

### What You Document

For every element:
- **What** is this component?
- **Why** does it exist? (trace to trigger map)
- **How** does it behave in each state?
- **What** content does it show?

### The Format

```markdown
## Sign Up Form

### Purpose
Allow new users to create an account with minimal friction.

### Connects To
- Persona: Felix the Full-Stack
- Trigger: "Want to try before committing"
- Feature: F03-Quick-Signup

### States
- Default: Empty form, CTA prominent
- Filling: Real-time validation
- Error: Inline messages
- Success: Redirect to welcome

### Content
- Headline: "Start building in 2 minutes"
- CTA: "Create Free Account"
```

**Nothing left to interpretation.**

---

## Module 12: Functional Interface Components

**Time: 45 min**

### Identify Reusable Patterns

As you specify, patterns emerge. Same button. Same card. Same form pattern.

### When to Extract

- Appears in 3+ places
- Has consistent behavior
- Worth maintaining centrally

### Component Definition

```markdown
## Button Component

### Variants
- Primary, Secondary, Ghost

### States
- Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading

### Usage Rules
- One primary per screen
- Always has icon OR label, not both
```

### Output

Component candidates for design system (if enabled).

---

## Module 13: Visual Design

**Time: 60 min • Making it real**

### From Concept to Visual

You have specifications. Now make them visible.

### Tools

- **Stitch** — AI generates from specs
- **Figma** — Refine and polish
- **html.to" — Import/export prototypes

### The Loop

```
Spec → Generate → Review → Refine → Generate → Approve
```

### Output

Visual prototypes matching specifications.

---

## Module 14: Design System Modes

**Time: 30 min**

### How Components Are Managed

Remember the four modes from setup?

| Mode | What Happens During Design |
|------|---------------------------|
| **1. None** | Styling inline, no extraction |
| **2. Building** | Freya suggests: "Extract as component?" |
| **3. Library** | "This matches shadcn Button" |
| **4. Existing** | "Use your Button from last project" |

### Building Mode (Most Common)

As you design, the system grows:

1. You specify a button
2. It appears again
3. Freya asks: "Create component?"
4. You say yes
5. Future buttons reference it

### Output

`D-Design-System/` populated with your components (if enabled).

---

## Module 15: Design Delivery

**Time: 45 min • Validate and package**

### Freya's Final Step

Before handoff:
1. **Validate** — Every spec complete?
2. **Package** — Organize for development
3. **Deliver** — Ready for Idunn

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] All states defined?
- [ ] Content complete (no lorem ipsum)?
- [ ] Interactions documented?
- [ ] Connects to trigger map?
- [ ] Developer can build from this alone?

### Output

```
E-PRD/Design-Deliveries/
└── DD01-User-Registration/
    ├── delivery-overview.md
    ├── scenarios/
    └── acceptance-criteria.md
```

---

# Implementation Phase — Idunn

## Module 16: Agentic Development

**Time: 60 min • Build iteratively**

### Design-to-Code Loop

Instead of: Design everything → Build everything → Hope it works

Try: Design one thing → Build it → Review → Iterate → Next

### Agent Dialogs

Document AI conversations:

```
docs/F-Agent-Dialogs/
└── 2026-02-10-login-flow/
    ├── dialog.md
    ├── decisions.md
    └── changes.md
```

### Why Document?

- You'll forget decisions
- Others need context
- AI context carries forward

---

## Module 17: Testing

**Time: 45 min**

### Verify Implementation Matches Spec

Code is written. Does it match your design?

### Browser-Based Testing

Open implementation. Open spec. Compare:

- Does the button say what you specified?
- Do states work as documented?
- Does content match?

### When It Doesn't Match

1. Spec unclear? → Update spec
2. Technically impossible? → Update spec + note
3. Just missed? → Fix implementation

**Specs are source of truth.**

---

## Module 18: Product Evolution

**Time: 30 min**

### Products Don't End at Launch

Users give feedback. Business shifts. Technology changes.

### The Cycle Continues

1. Capture feedback
2. Connect to trigger map
3. Update specs
4. Deliver changes
5. Test

**Same creative discipline. Smaller scope.**

### Your Design System Grows

Project 1: Building (Mode 2)
Project 2: Existing (Mode 4)

**Your work compounds.**
