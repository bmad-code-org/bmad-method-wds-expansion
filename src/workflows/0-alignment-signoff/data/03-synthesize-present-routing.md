# Phase 3: Synthesize & Present

**Goal:** Synthesize the section explorations into a complete alignment document, optionally create a VTC, and present for stakeholder approval.

**Your Role:** Reflect back what was captured, compile the alignment document, and guide the user through the approval process.

## Steps

| # | File | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| 01 | [Reflect Back](01-reflect-back.md) | Reflect back what you've captured from all sections |
| 02 | [Synthesize Document](02-synthesize-document.md) | Compile into alignment document using pitch template |
| 03 | [Create VTC](03-create-vtc.md) | Optional: Create Value Trigger Chain for strategic clarity |
| 04 | [Present for Approval](04-present-for-approval.md) | Present to stakeholders, handle feedback, iterate |

**Key principle:** The alignment phase is collaborative and iterative. Refine until everyone is on board.
