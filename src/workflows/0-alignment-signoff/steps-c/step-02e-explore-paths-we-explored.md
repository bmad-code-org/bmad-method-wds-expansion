# Substep 05: Explore Paths We Explored

**Purpose**: Help user articulate alternative approaches they considered

---

## Instruction

Explore paths they explored.

**Reference**: `{installed_path}/data/02-explore-sections-routing.md` (Section 4: Paths We Explored)

**Questions to explore**:
- "What other ways could we approach this?"
- "Are there alternative paths?"
- "What options have you considered?"

**Keep it brief** - 2-3 paths explored briefly

**If user only has one path**: That's fine - acknowledge it and move on
