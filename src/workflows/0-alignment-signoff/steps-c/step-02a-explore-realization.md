# Substep 01: Explore The Realization

**Purpose**: Help user articulate what they've realized needs attention

---

## Instruction

Explore the realization section with the user.

**Reference**: `{installed_path}/data/02-explore-sections-routing.md` (Section 1: The Realization)

**Questions to explore**:
- "What have you realized needs attention?"
- "What observation have you made?"
- "What challenge are you seeing?"
- "What evidence do you have that this is real?"

**Best Practice: Confirm the Realization with Evidence**

**Help them identify evidence:**

**Soft Evidence** (qualitative indicators):
- "Do you have testimonials or complaints about this?"
- "What have stakeholders told you?"
- "What patterns have you observed?"
- "What do user interviews reveal?"

**Hard Evidence** (quantitative data):
- "Do you have statistics or metrics?"
- "What do analytics show?"
- "Have you run surveys or tests?"
- "What do server logs or error reports indicate?"

**Help them combine both types** for maximum credibility.

**Keep it brief** - 2-3 sentences for the realization, plus 1-2 sentences of evidence
