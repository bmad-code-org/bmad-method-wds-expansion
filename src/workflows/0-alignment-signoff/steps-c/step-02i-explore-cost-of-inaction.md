# Substep 09: Explore Cost of Inaction

**Purpose**: Help user articulate what happens if we DON'T build this

---

## Instruction

Explore cost of inaction.

**Reference**: `{installed_path}/data/02-explore-sections-routing.md` (Section 8: Cost of Inaction)

**Questions to explore**:
- "What happens if we DON'T build this?"
- "What are the risks of not acting?"
- "What opportunities would we miss?"
- "What's the cost of doing nothing?"
- "What gets worse if we don't act?"
- "What do we lose by waiting?"

**Keep it brief** - Key consequences of not building

**Can include**: 
- Financial cost (lost revenue, increased costs)
- Opportunity cost (missed opportunities)
- Competitive risk (competitors gaining advantage)
- Operational impact (inefficiency, problems getting worse)

**Help them think**: Make the case for why we can't afford NOT to do this
