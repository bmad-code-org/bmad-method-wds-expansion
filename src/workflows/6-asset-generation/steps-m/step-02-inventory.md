# Step 02: Asset Inventory

**Goal:** Build a complete inventory of all images needed, organized by type and page.

---

## Actions

### 1. Catalog All Image Placements

| # | Image | Page | Type | Dimensions | Content |
|---|-------|------|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Hero banner | Homepage | hero | 1920×800 | [description] |
| 2 | Team photo | About | people | 800×600 | [description] |
| 3 | Product shot | Products | product | 600×600 | [description] |
| 4 | Background | Contact | decorative | 1920×1080 | [description] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 2. Group by Type

Organize for batch generation:
- **Hero images** — Large, prominent, define page mood
- **Product images** — Consistent lighting and framing
- **People/team** — Authentic feel, consistent treatment
- **Backgrounds** — Subtle, support content without competing
- **Illustrations** — Match chosen content style
- **Decorative** — Textures, patterns, dividers

### 3. Identify Batch Opportunities

Images that should share visual consistency:
- "All 17 vehicle images for product pages" → one batch, one style
- "All team member photos" → one batch, one lighting setup
- "All hero images" → one mood, varying subjects

### 4. Present Inventory

```
Image Inventory:
- Total images needed: [count]
- Batch groups: [count]
- Can reuse existing: [count]
