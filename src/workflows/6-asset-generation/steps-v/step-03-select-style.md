# Step 03: Select Style

**Goal:** Define the motion style — speed, feel, and visual treatment for animations and video.

---

## Actions

### 1. Motion Personality

```
Overall motion feel:

[S] Subtle       — Barely noticeable, professional (corporate, medical, finance)
[F] Fluid        — Smooth, organic movement (wellness, lifestyle, creative)
[E] Energetic    — Fast, dynamic, attention-grabbing (startup, gaming, youth)
[P] Precise      — Mechanical, deliberate, technical (engineering, data, SaaS)
```

### 2. Timing Parameters

Based on personality, set:

| Parameter | Subtle | Fluid | Energetic | Precise |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Base duration** | 500ms | 400ms | 200ms | 300ms |
| **Easing** | ease-in-out | cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1) | spring(1,80,10) | linear/steps |
| **Stagger** | 100ms | 80ms | 50ms | 60ms |
| **Loop delay** | 3s | 2s | 1s | 2s |

### 3. Video Style (for generated/produced video)

```
Video visual treatment:

[C] Cinematic     — Shallow depth of field, color graded, film-like
[D] Documentary   — Natural, authentic, handheld feel
[M] Motion design — Graphics-driven, animated typography, data viz
[A] Abstract      — Textures, shapes, ambient, no recognizable subjects
```

### 4. Color and Lighting

- Match brand palette
- Dark/light preference for backgrounds
- Contrast level for overlaid text

### 5. Confirm Style

```
Motion Style:
- Personality: [selected]
- Base duration: [ms]
- Easing: [curve]
- Video treatment: [selected]
- Color direction: [summary]
