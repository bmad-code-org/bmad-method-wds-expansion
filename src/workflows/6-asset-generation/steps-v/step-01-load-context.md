# Step 01: Load Context

**Goal:** Load motion content requirements — what needs to move, where, and why.

---

## Actions

### 1. Load Motion Requirements

From page specs, identify motion content:
- Hero animations (subtle background movement, text reveals)
- Product demonstrations (features in action)
- Micro-interactions (hover effects, transitions, loading states)
- Background video (ambient loops)
- Explainer sequences (step-by-step animations)

### 2. Load Design System Motion Tokens

Read motion/animation tokens:
- Duration scale (fast: 150ms, normal: 300ms, slow: 500ms)
- Easing curves (ease-in-out, spring, bounce)
- Transition types (fade, slide, scale, reveal)

### 3. Load Visual Assets

Check for assets that motion builds upon:
- Static images that need subtle animation (parallax, zoom)
- UI components that need state transitions
- Illustrations that could be animated

### 4. Summarize Context

```
Video/Motion Context:
- Motion assets needed: [count]
- Types: [hero, product demo, micro-interaction, background, explainer]
- Duration range: [shortest] to [longest]
- Existing static assets to animate: [count]
- Full video productions: [count]
```
