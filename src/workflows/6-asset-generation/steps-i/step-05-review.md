# Step 05: Review and Iterate

**Goal:** Review the complete icon set for visual consistency, clarity, and completeness.

---

## Actions

### 1. Present Full Icon Set

Display all icons in a grid:
- Organized by category
- Show at multiple sizes (sm, md, lg)
- Dark and light backgrounds to verify visibility

### 2. Consistency Check

Across the full set, verify:
- [ ] Stroke weight is uniform (for outline style)
- [ ] Visual weight is balanced (no icon looks heavier/lighter)
- [ ] Corner radius is consistent
- [ ] Level of detail is consistent (no overly complex outliers)
- [ ] Padding/live area is uniform
- [ ] All icons are recognizable at smallest size

### 3. Metaphor Clarity

For each icon, confirm:
- [ ] Icon clearly communicates its intended meaning
- [ ] No ambiguity with similar icons in the set
- [ ] Culturally appropriate metaphors

### 4. User Review

```
[A] Approve all           — Save complete icon set
[R] Regenerate [icons]    — Redo specific icons
[W] Weight adjust         — Change stroke weight globally
[S] Size test             — Show all at minimum intended size
[C] Context preview       — Show icons placed in UI mockup
```

### 5. Generate Size Variants

For approved icons, generate required sizes:
- SVG (scalable, primary format)
- PNG at 1x, 2x, 3x for each defined size

### 6. Save Approved Set

Save to `{output_folder}/E-Assets/icons/`:
- `svg/` — all SVG files
- `png/` — size variant PNGs organized by size
- `icon-set-summary.md` — catalog with previews and usage notes

### 7. Update Design Log

Record:
- Icons generated: [count]
- Style: [outline/filled/duotone]
- Categories: [list]
- Consistency: [pass/issues]
