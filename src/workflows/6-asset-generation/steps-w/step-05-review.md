# Step 05: Review and Iterate

**Goal:** Review generated wireframes as a set, ensure consistency, and iterate on any that need work.

---

## Actions

### 1. Present Full Set

Display all generated wireframes grouped by page:
- Desktop and mobile side by side (where both exist)
- Highlight any that look inconsistent with the set

### 2. Consistency Check

Verify across the set:
- [ ] Grid alignment consistent across pages
- [ ] Navigation placement consistent
- [ ] Typography hierarchy consistent
- [ ] Spacing feels uniform
- [ ] Content zones properly labeled (if annotations on)

### 3. User Review

```
Review wireframes:

[A] Approve all        — Save and continue
[R] Regenerate [#]     — Pick specific wireframes to redo
[S] Style adjust       — Change fidelity/style and regenerate all
[E] Edit annotations   — Adjust labels and notes
```

### 4. Iterate

For any wireframes marked for regeneration:
- Gather user feedback on what to change
- Adjust prompt accordingly
- Regenerate with updated parameters
- Use approved wireframes as reference for consistency

### 5. Save Approved Set

Save all approved wireframes to `{output_folder}/E-Assets/wireframes/`:
- `{page-name}-desktop.png`
- `{page-name}-mobile.png`
- `wireframe-set-summary.md` — index of all wireframes with notes

### 6. Update Design Log

Record in design log:
- Wireframes generated: [count]
- Style used: [fidelity + design style]
- Pages covered: [list]
