# Step 03: Select Style

**Goal:** Choose the visual approach for wireframe generation — fidelity level and annotation style.

---

## Actions

### 1. Present Wireframe Fidelity Options

```
Wireframe fidelity:

[L] Low-Fi     — Boxes and labels only, fastest generation
[M] Mid-Fi     — Recognizable components, basic typography hierarchy
[H] High-Fi    — Near-realistic layout with placeholder content
```

### 2. Load Design Style

Load the project's selected design style from `data/styles/design-styles/`:
- Extract layout principles and spacing feel
- Apply to wireframe structure (e.g., minimal = lots of whitespace, brutalist = dense grid)

### 3. Annotation Options

```
Include annotations?

[Y] Yes  — Label content zones, note responsive behavior, mark interactions
[N] No   — Clean wireframes only
```

### 4. Confirm Style

```
Wireframe Style:
- Fidelity: [selected]
- Design influence: [loaded style name]
- Annotations: [yes/no]
- Dimensions: Desktop [width]px, Mobile [width]px
```
