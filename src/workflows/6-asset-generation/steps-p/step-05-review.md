# Step 05: Review and Iterate

**Goal:** Review page designs as a cohesive set, verify design system compliance, and iterate.

---

## Actions

### 1. Present Design Set

Show all page designs:
- Group by page (desktop + mobile pairs)
- Show full-page scrollable views

### 2. Design System Compliance

Check each design against the design system:
- [ ] Colors match palette tokens
- [ ] Typography follows the type scale
- [ ] Spacing follows the spacing scale
- [ ] Components match design system patterns
- [ ] Responsive layout follows breakpoint rules

### 3. Cross-Page Consistency

Verify across the full set:
- [ ] Navigation looks identical across pages
- [ ] Footer consistent
- [ ] Color usage consistent (primary for CTAs, etc.)
- [ ] Typography hierarchy consistent
- [ ] Visual rhythm feels unified

### 4. User Review

```
[A] Approve all         — Save full set
[R] Regenerate [#]      — Redo specific pages
[S] Style adjust        — Change style and regenerate
[D] Detail edit [#]     — Adjust specific element on a page
[C] Compare             — Side-by-side comparison of selected pages
```

### 5. Iterate

For pages marked for changes:
- Capture specific feedback
- Adjust prompt with corrections
- Regenerate with approved pages as reference
- Re-review changed pages in context of the set

### 6. Save Approved Set

Save to `{output_folder}/E-Assets/page-designs/`:
- `{page-name}-desktop.png`
- `{page-name}-mobile.png`
- `page-design-set-summary.md`

### 7. Update Design Log

Record:
- Pages designed: [count]
- Styles: [design style] + [content style]
- Compliance: [pass/issues noted]
