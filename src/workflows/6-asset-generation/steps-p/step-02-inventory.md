| 1 | [page] | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | High/Med/Low |

### 2. Assess Readiness

For each page, check:
- **Wireframe**: Structural layout approved?
- **Content**: Real copy available or placeholder needed?
- **Images**: Source images available or need generation first?
- **Components**: All needed components defined in design system?

### 3. Flag Dependencies

Pages that need other assets first:
- "Hero image needed before Homepage design" → suggest [M] Images activity first
- "Icon set needed before Features page" → suggest [I] Icons activity first

### 4. Present Inventory

```
Page Design Inventory:
- Ready to design: [count] pages
- Blocked (need other assets): [count] pages
- Already designed: [count] pages

Proceed with [count] ready pages?
```
