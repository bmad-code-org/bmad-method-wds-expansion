## Quality Reminders

When filling this template, check:

**Entry Point** — Would a real person arrive this way? Include device, location, search terms.

**Mental State** — Can you FEEL the user's emotional state? "Interested" is not enough. "Panicked because family vacation is at risk" is.

**Success Goals** — "Get more customers" fails. "Reduce info calls by 40% by giving tourists the info they need online" passes.

**Shortest Path** — Count the steps. Can you remove any? Each step must justify its existence. If you can't defend why a step is there, remove it.

**Trigger Map** — Don't invent a user. Use the actual persona from the Trigger Map with their actual driving forces.
