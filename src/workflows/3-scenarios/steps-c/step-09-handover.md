## 2. What Comes Next

Explain to user:

```
**Next Steps:**

**Phase 4: UX Design** takes each scenario outline and adds:
- Detailed page specifications (visual state, interactions, components)
- Wireframe sketches
- Object IDs for every element
- Error states and edge cases (AFTER the sunshine path is solid)

**The scenario outlines are the foundation.** Phase 4 builds the detailed design on top of them.

Would you like to continue to Phase 4, or take a break?
