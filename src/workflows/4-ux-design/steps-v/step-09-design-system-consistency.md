# Validation Step 09: Design System Consistency

**Goal:** Verify components are used correctly and consistently across all page specifications.

---

## Checks

### 1. Component Usage

- [ ] All components reference design system definitions
- [ ] No inline component definitions that should be in design system
- [ ] Component variants used appropriately (not mixing similar components)

### 2. Naming Consistency

- [ ] Component names match design system registry
- [ ] No duplicate component names with different definitions
- [ ] Naming follows established conventions

### 3. Cross-Page Consistency

- [ ] Shared components (header, footer, nav) identical across pages
- [ ] Similar patterns use the same components (not ad-hoc alternatives)
- [ ] State definitions consistent for same components across pages

### 4. Design System Completeness

- [ ] All referenced components exist in design system
- [ ] No orphaned components (defined but never used)
- [ ] Component documentation sufficient for implementation
