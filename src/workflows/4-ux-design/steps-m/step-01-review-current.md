# Step 01: Review Current Design System

**Goal:** Understand the current state of the design system before making changes.

## Process

### 1. Load Design System

Check `{output_folder}/D-UX-Design/design-system/` for existing components.

### 2. Inventory

List all defined components with:
- Name
- Category (layout, navigation, content, form, etc.)
- Usage count across page specifications
- Last updated

### 3. Identify Gaps

Cross-reference with page specifications to find:
- Components used in specs but not in design system
- Components in design system but not used anywhere
- Inconsistencies in component usage

### 4. Present Status

Show the user the current state and ask what they'd like to do:
- Define a new component
- Update an existing component
- Review usage consistency

## Next Step

Based on user choice:
- Define/update → `step-02-define-component.md`
- Validate → `step-03-validate-usage.md`
