# Step 02: Define or Update Component

**Goal:** Create a new design system component or update an existing one.

---

## Process

### 1. Component Context

- What is this component? (name, purpose)
- Where is it used? (which pages/sections)
- Is it a variant of an existing component?

### 2. Define Component

Using the object-types templates in `{installed_path}/data/object-types/templates/`:

- **Properties:** configurable attributes
- **States:** default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading
- **Variants:** size, color, layout variations
- **Content:** text, images, labels
- **Interactions:** click, hover, focus behaviors
- **Responsive:** mobile, tablet, desktop adaptations

### 3. Complexity Assessment

Reference `{installed_path}/data/object-types/COMPLEXITY-ROUTER.md`:

- Simple (single element, few states)
- Moderate (multiple elements, several states)
- Complex (nested components, many interactions)

### 4. Save

Write component definition to `{output_folder}/D-UX-Design/design-system/`
