# Step 01: Choose Visual Approach

**Goal:** Determine which visual tool and approach to use for this page.

---

## Process

### 1. Review Page Specification

Load the page specification and understand:
- Page purpose and key sections
- Component complexity
- Visual fidelity needed

### 2. Present Tool Options

```
How would you like to create the visual design?

[N] Nano Banana — AI-generated mockup (quick, exploratory)
[F] Figma — Professional design tool (precise, production-ready)
[H] HTML Prototype — Code-based design (interactive, responsive)
[W] Wireframe — Quick layout sketch (fast, structural)
```

### 3. Setup Gate (Nano Banana only)

If user selects [N]:
1. Check for existing agent dialog for this page in `{output_folder}/_progress/agent-dialogs/`
   - If active dialog found: offer to resume previous visual generation session
2. If first time using Nano Banana in this project:
   - Route to `step-00-nb-setup.md` to verify MCP connection
   - Return here after verification succeeds

### 4. Capture Choice

Record the chosen approach and any specific instructions (style preferences, reference images, etc.).
