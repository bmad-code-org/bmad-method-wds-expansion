# Step 1: Inspiration Analysis Workshop

**Goal:** Analyze reference sites with the client to document concrete visual/UX preferences.

**Load agent guide:** `src/data/agent-guides/saga/inspiration-analysis.md` for full strategic context on WHY this matters and WHAT to surface.

## 1. Collect Reference URLs

Ask client for 2-4 sites they find inspiring. Can be competitors, sites with appealing style, or sites with UX patterns they like.

If client has no references, offer to find examples in their industry.

## 2. Analyze Each Site Together

For each site:
- Load/screenshot the site using browser tools or WebFetch
- Ask open-ended first: "What drew you to this site?"
- Probe specific elements visible on the site
- Capture reactions with the WHY (not just like/dislike)
- Extract principles as patterns emerge

## 3. Synthesize Design Principles

After all sites:
- Organize findings by category (layout, content, visual, UX)
- Identify patterns across sites
- Confirm synthesis with client

## 4. Document

Create `inspiration-analysis.md` in the Product Brief output folder using the template at `{project-root}/_bmad/wds/templates/1-project-brief/inspiration-analysis.template.md`.

## Agent Dialog Integration

Follow the same agent dialog pattern as other PB workflows:
- Create/update dialog entry for this workshop
- Document key questions, answers, and insights
- Note which elements were liked/disliked and why
