# Step 7: Synthesize & Review

## Purpose

Complete the Visual Direction document with a clear, actionable summary.

## Context for Agent

Create a synthesis that designers can use as a clear reference. The "Visual DNA" summary should be memorable and directive.

## Instructions

1. **Compile design constraints**

   Gather constraints from:
   - Platform Requirements (technical limitations)
   - Brand requirements (partner badges, etc.)
   - Content needs (multilingual, etc.)

   List all constraints that affect design.

2. **Create Visual DNA summary**

   Synthesize all decisions into a quick-reference format:

   ```
   Style:        [UI style + aesthetic in one line]
   Colors:       [Palette direction in one line]
   Typography:   [Type approach in one line]
   Mood:         [3-5 mood keywords]
   Key Element:  [Single most important visual element]
   ```

   This should be scannable and memorable.

3. **Review completeness**

   Check that all sections are filled:
   - [ ] Existing Brand Assets
   - [ ] Visual References
   - [ ] Design Style
   - [ ] Color Direction
   - [ ] Typography Direction
   - [ ] Layout Direction
   - [ ] Visual Effects
   - [ ] Photography & Imagery
   - [ ] Design Constraints

4. **Present summary to user**

   Show the Visual DNA summary:

   "Here's the visual direction in a nutshell:"
   [Show summary]

   "Does this capture what you're envisioning?"

5. **Validate with key decisions**

   Confirm the most impactful choices:
   - "We're going with [UI style] — correct?"
   - "Colors will be [direction] — right?"
   - "Photography will be [style] — good?"

6. **Next steps guidance**

   Explain what's next:
   - "Visual Direction will guide all design work in Phase 4"
   - "This feeds into the Design System in Phase 5"
   - "Designers will reference this for every decision"

7. **Finalize and save**

   - Complete all template sections
   - Save final document
   - Confirm reference files are organized

## Completion

This workflow is complete when:
- Visual Direction document is finalized
- User has confirmed the direction
- Visual DNA summary is clear and actionable
- Reference files are organized
