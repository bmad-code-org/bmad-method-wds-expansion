# Step 5.5: Content Structure Principles

## Purpose

Capture the client's vision for what the product should contain — pages, sections, content priorities, and navigation principles.

## Context for Agent

**This is NOT about detailed specifications.** It's about capturing the client's mental model at whatever level of detail they have. Some clients have a clear vision ("single-page site with hero, services, map, contact"). Others are still exploring ("maybe 5 pages?"). Both are valid.

**Why this matters:** Without this, Scenario Outlining (Phase 4) and Dream Up agents design flows through pages that may not match what the client envisions. Capturing principles now prevents costly misalignment later.

**Load agent guide:** `src/data/agent-guides/saga/content-structure-principles.md` for full strategic context.

## Instructions

1. **Open the conversation naturally**

   The client has just discussed tone of voice, language, and SEO. Now shift to the product itself.

   Explore what they're envisioning for the product structure. Adapt your questions based on the type of product (website, app, platform) and how specific or exploratory the client is.

2. **Surface content priorities**

   Understand what content is critical vs. secondary vs. nice-to-have. What must be visible immediately? What's important but can live deeper?

3. **Capture navigation principles**

   Not navigation design — principles. "Services should be easy to find from any page" is a principle. "Hamburger menu with dropdown" is a specification.

4. **Document explicit constraints**

   What should NOT be included? These are as valuable as what should. "No blog, no online booking" are clear scope boundaries.

5. **Note the client's clarity level**

   Document whether the client has a strong vision, is exploring, or is completely open. This tells later phases how much latitude they have.

6. **Document in content-language.md**

   Add a "Content Structure Principles" section with whatever emerged from the conversation. Use the format examples in the agent guide.
