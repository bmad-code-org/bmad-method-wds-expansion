## About This Folder

The `_progress` folder is the memory of your design process. It tracks what happened, when, and why — so any agent or human can pick up where you left off.

**Contents:**
- **This file** — Design log with phase progress and key decisions
- **agent-dialogs/** — Conversation records between agents and humans, persisted across sessions
- **wds-project-outline.yaml** — Project configuration from Phase 0 setup

**Learn more:** WDS Course Module 02 (Installation & Setup), Lesson 4: WDS Initialization

## For Agents

**Your dialog files go in `agent-dialogs/`.** Name them: `YYYY-MM-DD-agent-topic.md`

When you complete a phase milestone, add an entry to the Progress section below. When the user makes a key decision, record it in Key Decisions.

**Do not modify `wds-project-outline.yaml`** — it is the source of truth for project configuration.
