## What Belongs Here

The Trigger Map reveals the human forces behind product decisions through five workshops:

1. **Business Goals** — What the business needs to achieve
2. **Target Groups** — Who the users are (with alliterative persona names)
3. **Driving Forces** — What motivates and frightens each persona (positive + negative)
4. **Prioritization** — Which forces matter most (scored by frequency, intensity, fit)
5. **Feature Impact** — How product features address the highest-priority forces

This folder feeds directly into Phase 4 (UX Scenarios). Every page spec should trace back to a driving force documented here.

## For Agents

**Workflow:** `_bmad/wds/workflows/2-trigger-mapping/workflow.md`
**Agent trigger:** `TM` (Saga)
**Templates:** `_bmad/wds/templates/2-trigger-mapping/`

**Before writing anything in this folder:**
1. Read the Product Brief in `A-Product-Brief/` — trigger mapping builds on it
2. Load the workflow and follow the five workshop sequence
3. Use Dialog mode — personas emerge from conversation, not invention

**File naming:** Number all documents with a two-digit prefix: `01-business-goals.md`, `02-lars-the-loyal.md`, etc. One file per persona. Update the Documents table below as each file is created.

**Harm:** Inventing personas without discovery. Fabricated driving forces produce scenarios that solve imaginary problems. The user pays to correct work that should never have been written.

**Help:** Uncovering real psychology through conversation. When driving forces are authentic, every downstream design decision has a clear "why."
