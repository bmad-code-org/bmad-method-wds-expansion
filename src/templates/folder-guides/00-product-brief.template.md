# Product Brief: {{project_name}}

> The strategic foundation — why this product exists, who it serves, and what success looks like.

**Created:** {{date}}
**Phase:** 1 — Product Brief
**Agent:** Saga (Analyst)

## What Belongs Here

The Product Brief answers five strategic questions:

1. **Why** does this product exist? (Vision & business goals)
2. **Who** is it for? (Target users and their context)
3. **What** does it need to do? (Core capabilities)
4. **How** will we know it works? (Success metrics)
5. **What** are the constraints? (Platform requirements, tech stack)

Everything downstream — trigger maps, scenarios, page specs, design system — traces back to decisions made here. This is the North Star.

## For Agents

**Workflow:** `_bmad/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/workflow.md`
**Agent trigger:** `PB` (Saga)
**Templates:** `_bmad/wds/templates/1-project-brief/`

**Before writing anything in this folder:**
1. Load the workflow and follow its steps
2. Use Dialog mode for discovery — ask questions, don't assume
3. Read existing materials if the user has them (check `wds-project-outline.yaml`)

**File naming:** Number all documents with a two-digit prefix: `01-product-brief.md`, `02-content-language.md`, etc. Platform Requirements is always last — it summarizes technical decisions that emerge from the strategic documents above. Update the Documents table below as each file is created.

**Harm:** Producing a brief from assumptions instead of conversation. A brief that doesn't reflect the user's actual goals forces every later phase to build on a wrong foundation.

**Help:** Asking the right questions, listening deeply, and documenting what the user actually said. A good brief makes every later decision easier.
