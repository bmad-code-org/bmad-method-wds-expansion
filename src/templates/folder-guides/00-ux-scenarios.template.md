## What Belongs Here

Scenarios organize the product into meaningful user journeys. Each scenario groups related pages. Each page gets a full specification that a developer can build from.

**Folder structure per scenario:**
```
C-UX-Scenarios/
├── 00-ux-scenarios.md          ← This file (scenario guide + page index)
├── 01-scenario-name/
│   ├── 1.1-page-name/
│   │   ├── 1.1-page-name.md   ← Page specification
│   │   └── Sketches/           ← Wireframes and concepts

## For Agents

### Scenario Outline (Saga)
**Workflow:** `_bmad/wds/workflows/3-scenarios/workflow.md`
**Agent trigger:** `SC` (Saga)

### Page Specifications (Freya)
**Workflow:** `_bmad/wds/workflows/4-ux-design/workflow.md`
**Agent trigger:** `UX` (Freya)
**Page template:** `_bmad/wds/workflows/4-ux-design/templates/page-specification.template.md`
**Scenario template:** `_bmad/wds/workflows/4-ux-design/templates/scenario-overview.template.md`
**Quality guide:** `_bmad/wds/data/agent-guides/freya/specification-quality.md`
**Object types:** `_bmad/wds/workflows/4-ux-design/object-types/`

### Specification Audit (Freya)
**Workflow:** `_bmad/wds/workflows/4-ux-design/specification-audit-workflow.md`
**Agent trigger:** `SA` (Freya)

**Before writing any page specification:**
1. Read `B-Trigger-Map/` — know the personas and their driving forces
2. Read the page specification template — use it as your scaffold, not memory
3. Discuss the page purpose with the user before filling in details
4. Each page folder needs a `Sketches/` subfolder for wireframes

**Harm:** Producing page specs from memory of what the template "roughly" contains. Plausible-looking specs that use wrong structure break the pipeline — developers can't trust them, audits can't validate them, and the user must correct what should have been right.

**Help:** Reading the actual template into context, discussing page purpose with the user, then filling the template with specific content. Specs that follow the template work across projects, pass audits, and give developers confidence.
